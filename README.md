this is new version of the app without authentication and file selection.

1. Download any mp3 format audio file and put it in public folder
2. rename the file with "test.mp3"

then you will be able to run the app with the file.

if you want to edit UI of the main screen, then go "src" -> "components" -> "spectrogramview.js"
